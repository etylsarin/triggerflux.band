	<p className="lead">
		Triggerflux is a high-voltage electro-clash unit built on raw energy,
		dirty disco attitude, and ferocious live presence. Formed on the fringes of
		Adelaide&apos;s underground rave scene, the band fuses breakbeat chaos, layered
		interlocking guitar hooks, live drums, and destructive club sonics into a singular explosive identity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fronted by Mara Keaton, Triggerflux channels the sweat of warehouse raves and
		the defiance of those who refuse to be silenced.

	<h2>{`Break the Silence (2025)`}</h2>
	<p>
		Twelve tracks of electro-clash fury and dirty disco swagger. From the creeping tension of
		"Voltage Drop" to the melancholic orbit of "Satellite Heart," Break the Silence
		maps the territory between rave euphoria and gritty nocturnal glamour.
	</p>
	<p>
		The album opens with dark tension before exploding into anarchic defiance.
		It descends through nocturnal cityscapes — ghost frequencies, mechanical disco swagger,
		magnetic pulls. The heart of the album beats in its contrasts: sassy electro-clash
		swagger sits alongside dark electro-pop disillusionment; desperate dancefloor highs
		fade into hollow comedowns.
