	<p className="eyebrow">About</p>
	<p className="lead">
		Triggerflux is a high-voltage electro-clash unit built on raw energy,
		dirty disco attitude, and ferocious live presence. Formed on the fringes of
		Adelaide&apos;s underground rave scene, the band fuses breakbeat chaos, layered
		interlocking guitar hooks, live drums, and destructive club sonics into a
		singular explosive identity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Fronted by vocalist Mara Keaton, whose fierce, commanding delivery became
		the band&apos;s ignition point, Triggerflux channels the sweat of warehouse raves
		and the defiance of those who refuse to be silenced. Drummer Ethan Cole brings
		brutal live breakbeats rooted in classic rave rhythms. Guitarist Liam Mercer
		layers interlocking loops with melodic arpeggios and gritty riffs. And
		DJ/producer Vex architects the glitch-heavy sampling, distorted synth work,
		and explosive bass programming that defines the Triggerflux sound.

	<p className="eyebrow">Origin Story</p>
	<p>
		What started as a late-night studio experiment between musicians obsessed with
		distorted breakbeats, cyberpunk textures, and the fury of 90s big beat quickly
		evolved into something larger. When Mara Keaton — known for her sharp, scorching
		vocal delivery — joined the project, her voice became the ignition point. The
		lineup solidified, the sound crystallised, and Triggerflux was born.
	</p>
	<p>
		The name says it all: a trigger point where energy becomes unstoppable, a flux
		state of constant motion and transformation.
	</p>

	<p className="eyebrow">Sound</p>
	<p>
		Triggerflux exists at the crossroads of electro-clash, dirty disco, dance-punk,
		and 90s rave energy. The result is music that hits like a detonation — punchy
		grooves, layered interlocking guitar hooks, and incendiary vocal hooks over
		breakbeat foundations.
	</p>
	<p>
		The production refuses to sit still. Dark trip-hop builds erupt into industrial
		breakbeat. Noir electro-pop melts into dirty disco swagger. Dreamy synth haze
		gives way to euphoric dance-punk. But every experiment stays rooted in the same
		foundation: electro-clash grit, dirty disco grooves, and hypnotic layered guitars.

	<p className="eyebrow">Debut Album</p>
	<h2>{`Break the Silence (2026)`}</h2>
	<p className="lead">
		Twelve tracks of electro-clash fury and dirty disco swagger, forged in the
		basements and warehouses where Adelaide&apos;s underground still pulses. A manifesto
		in layered guitar hooks, nasty synth bass, and fractured rhythms, born from
		late-night sessions and an obsession with sounds the mainstream forgot.
	</p>
	<p>
		The album opens with the creeping dark trip-hop tension of &ldquo;Voltage
		Drop&rdquo; before exploding into the dystopian electro defiance of
		&ldquo;Riot Soul&rdquo; and the cinematic noir electro-pop of
		&ldquo;Shockwave.&rdquo; From there, the journey descends through nocturnal
		cityscapes — the nu skool breaks and underground rave chaos of &ldquo;Dead
		Signal,&rdquo; the hypnotic dreamy groove of &ldquo;Iron Pulse,&rdquo; the
		swaggering magnetic pull of &ldquo;Magnet Run.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>
		The album&apos;s heart beats in its contrasts. &ldquo;Velvet Static&rdquo; builds
		from silky restraint into euphoric intensity. &ldquo;Glass Highway&rdquo; drifts
		through a warm synth haze on dreamy interlocking arpeggios. &ldquo;Lipstick
		Traces&rdquo; brings sassy electro-clash swagger before the dark disco noir
		disillusionment of &ldquo;Hollow Crown.&rdquo;
	</p>
	<p>
		The final act turns inward — &ldquo;Lifted&rdquo; captures the euphoric
		desperation of the dancefloor and the bittersweet comedown when the lights come
		up. The album closes with &ldquo;Satellite Heart,&rdquo; a cosmic, longing orbit
		around love that won&apos;t let go.
	</p>
	<p>
		Mara Keaton&apos;s vocals command every track — breathy intimacy erupting into
		full-throated rebellion, close-mic confessions one moment, fierce belting the
		next. The production refuses to sit still, but every experiment stays rooted in
		electro-clash grit, dirty disco grooves, and hypnotic layered guitars.
	</p>
	<p>
		This is music for 3AM — for the moment when the bass hits your chest and the
		strobes freeze time. For the ones who never stopped transmitting.

	<p>
		Triggerflux shows are chaotic, immersive, and unpredictably intense — a collision
		of performance, sound design, and raw human energy. So far, the band has played
		only small underground venues and warehouse parties around Adelaide — sweaty rooms
		with a few dozen people who stumbled in looking for something real. No festival
		stages yet, no headline slots. Just intimate chaos where the bass rattles the
		walls and everyone leaves drenched. The bigger stages will come. For now, this is
		where the sound belongs.
	</p>

<section className="section" id="philosophy">
	<p className="eyebrow">Philosophy</p>
	<p>
		Triggerflux stands for defiance against conformity and silence. For motion over
		stagnation. For controlled chaos as a creative force. For staying rooted in the
		underground scenes that shaped the sound — not as a stepping stone to something
		bigger, but as the foundation of everything.
	</p>
	<p>
		The world hasn&apos;t heard of Triggerflux yet. That&apos;s fine. The ones who need this
		music will find it. This is music for the ones who never stopped transmitting.
